      "\n",
      "- Use the Runnable and Chain abstractions. Runnables and Chains make it easy to build reusable components that can be composed into larger programs. The abstractions handle things like state management, observability, and composability.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Leverage agent toolkits. Agent toolkits contain integrations with external resources like APIs, databases, etc. This allows you to build applications that combine LLMs with external data sources and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Evaluate and monitor your systems. LangChain includes tools for evaluating chains and models using datasets. You can also integrate with LangSmith to evaluate systems and monitor them in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Follow security best practices. Carefully inspect the capabilities of toolkits and components you use. Sandbox access to things like Python REPLs. See the LangChain security docs for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Build modular, maintainable systems. The LangChain abstractions encourage building systems from reusable, loosely coupled components. This makes systems easier to monitor, secure, and update over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in summary, relying on the core LangChain abstractions, leveraging toolkits judiciously, and following security best practices will help you build robust, production-grade systems.\n",
      "Here are a few ways to use LangChain for production:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Use the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to build declarative programs that can run synchronously, asynchronously, in batch, or streaming. The async and batch support allows LCEL programs to scale well.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Build composable chains that encode reusable sequences of calls to models, retrievers, etc. The composability makes it easy to combine and reuse components.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Add stateful memory to chains when needed to maintain context across executions. The ConversationBufferMemory is useful for dialog systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Use tools like VectorStoreToolkit and RetrieverTool to integrate external resources like databases and APIs. This allows combining LLMs with real-world data.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Monitor and log executions by passing Callbacks to chains. This helps with observability.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Evaluate chains offline using the evaluation module before deployment. Can load datasets and evaluators like \"qa\" and \"embedding_distance\".\n",
      "\n",
      "- Use LangSmith to evaluate chains online against custom test sets. Provides additional evaluators beyond the core LangChain ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Sandbox tools like PythonREPLTool appropriately for security. Avoid giving unchecked access to production systems.\n",
